# The Art of Simplicity

We often overcomplicate things. We add layers of abstraction, install massive libraries for simple tasks, and build "future-proof" architectures for problems we don't haven't yet.

## The Power of Focus

<Motion initial={{ x: -20, opacity: 0 }} animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }} client:visible>

  <div class="p-4 border border-zinc-700 rounded-lg my-4 bg-zinc-900">
    This box is animated directly inside markdown!
  </div>
</Motion>

When we focus on the **essential**, we create better products.

```javascript
// Keep it simple
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
